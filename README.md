# Re-Join
2 cases :
  - If in a domain : Remove computer from domain, restart and log-in local administrator automatically, re-add computer to domain and restart.
  - If not in a domain : Add computer to domain and restart

Use Join.bat preferably, to bypass execution policy and run as administrator with a simple double click!
